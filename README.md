# Workday Scheduler

## Description 

This web application is a simple daily scheduler i designed for a challenge in a front-end developer bootcamp I'm curently attending.  

* Each time-block is colour-coded according to whether the time is in the past , present , or future .
* Users can save events by inputting text in a time-block and then clicking the save button on the right.
* Events can be removed by deleting text and then clicking the save button, or by clearing all schedule button on the bottom page.  
* There is also a box on top, displaying the current event , or if there are any future events/ or none.
* Buttons on the left will turn red to indicate saving the data.
